# Communication App Clone

This is my first clone project using HTML and CSS.

**Inspiration**
The app I cloned is KakaoTalk, a widely used mobile instant messaging application in South Korea.

**Process**
Although this was a clone project, I wanted to add a bit of creativity and decided to do a quick branding design. I came up with an idea that it will be a communication app for designers. I designed the logo, some of the icons, and constructed a brief design system for the font and color palette to ensure visual consistency.
